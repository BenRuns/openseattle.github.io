## What we do.

Open Seattle runs a weekly civic hacking night, as well as hackathons and other events focused on building the civic technology community in Seattle and building prototype solutions for local civic issues.

## Open Seattle is a "brigade" of Code for America

We are a <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a>, which means we're a group of Seattleites that contribute our talents towards improving the way our local governments and community organizations use the web. 

Open Seattle is about action and you're here because you are someone who takes action. <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/activities">See what kind of things brigades do</a>, or <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/03/08/jennifer-pahlka-at-ted-video/">watch this inspirational TED talk given by Jennifer Pahlka, the founder of Code for America.</a></p>
