You have a difficult decision this week: will you hack for **fish** or for **space**?

## Fishackathon: April 22-24

Fishackathon Seattle is one of 41 simultaneous hackathons taking place worldwide, coordinated by the U.S. Department of State in an effort to inspire tech solutions to our global fishery challenges. 

Fishackathon was established to congregate brilliant minds for the purpose of developing usable solutions to address the problem of worldwide overfishing. Overfishing harms the marine environment and diminishes the already meager income of small scale fishermen. Fishackathon brings together computer programmers to find innovative ways to collect and analyze data, and find solutions for unsustainable fishing practices.

Participants will be asked to hack on one of nine challenges related to sustainable fishing, which will be unveiled Friday, April 22. Teams can also choose a challenge of their own design.
