## Edit Seattle-related pages on LocalWiki
- Skills: Writing, Research
- Time: However long you want to spend

LocalWiki a grassroots effort to collect, share, and open the world's local knowledge. We want every community to have a community-created local knowledge commons that answers the question "where would I go if I wanted to learn everything there is to know about my community?"

Make sure that all the important information about your community is on the wiki.
