Our goals for [Art + Civics + Code](http://artcivicscode.com) were to get artists & technologists teamed up on addressing civic issues, and to build projects related to public art in Seattle.  One of the best outcomes of a hackathon is getting groups of people together who might not otherwise collaborate on projects to brainstorm and prototype solutions to problems they face in their communities. Art + Civics + Code was a playful event that produced fun & useful projects and brought out people who had never attended a hackathon before.

Here are the projects & activities from the day:

## Memory Lane

![street view team](https://discuss.openseattle.org/uploads/default/39/27949a49baaab49a.JPG)

Ethan Phelps-Goodman, Allie Sterling, Rob Middleton, and Paul Ort created a way to explore Seattle neighborhoods that show Google's StreetView from this year paired with their images from 7 years ago. It's interesting to see how things have changed even just over the last 7 years. 

Moving forward, the goal of the project is to create new, interactive ways of visualizing land use change and development for communities.

The code is on GitHub: [github.com/ethanpg/memory-lane](https://github.com/ethanpg/memory-lane)

## Frye comments

Josh Peterson & team worked on various ways of analyzing and visualizing comments from the Frye Museum's _#SocialMedium_ exhibit. [Here is one of the visualizations created by Eric Valpey](https://public.tableausoftware.com/profile/valpey#!/vizhome/FryeComments/FryeComments). 

## Ambient, physical visualization of crime

Shelly Farnham's project used an arduino and [nearly-realtime crime data](https://data.seattle.gov/browse?category=Public+Safety) to create a visualization that doesn't require looking at a computer screen.

## Seward Park Stories

Mike Wheaton, Christina Montilla, & Wendy Call planned and mocked up Seward Park Stories, a project documenting cultural and historical locations in Seward Park.

## Explore.js

Harini K and Seth Vincent worked on explore.js, a prototype of an open-source tool for making maps of artwalk locations.

The code is on GitHub:

## OSM Seattle Public Art Map

Ann Summy & Igor Talpalatski worked on uploading and tagging public art locations and descriptions from Seattle government data to [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org), a public, free map data resource.

## Maptime office hours

Sam Matthews and Clifford Snow held Maptime "office hours," making themselves available to help anyone wanting to learn how to make online maps.

Maptime happens other times, too. You should make time for Maptime: [meetup.com/MaptimeSEA](http://meetup.com/MaptimeSEA)
